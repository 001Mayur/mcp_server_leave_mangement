ðŸ§¾ MCP Server - Leave Management
This is an MCP (Model Code Protocol) server that reads leave data from an Excel file and allows AI agents like Claude to access that data through natural language commands.

ðŸ’¡ What is MCP?
MCP lets you connect AI agents (like Claude) to your custom Python code using tools. When you run an MCP server, the AI can call your Python functions just by understanding your prompt.

This project is built to demonstrate that with a Leave Management use case.

ðŸ“Œ Use Case
Employees apply for leave using traditional methods like forms or Excel. This project makes it easy for AI agents to answer leave-related questions such as:

"Who is on leave today?"

"How many leaves has employee 1001 taken this year?"

"Show me all employees on leave in March."
